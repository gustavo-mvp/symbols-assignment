# Symbols Assignment

## How to run the CLI file

### Globally
1. Install the package globally into your system
```
npm install -g .
```

2. Now you can user anywhere:
```
create-symbols-grid -x 10 -y 8 -d ./my-project
```

### Without installing

1. Run `yarn` to install `commander` package
2. Make the file executable `chmod +x cli.js`
3. Run the script: `./cli.js -x 10 -y 8 -d ./grid-selector`

It will clone the "starter-kit" repo and make changes to apply the Grid Selector
